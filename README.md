ðŸ§  Behavioral Gap Classification & Session Flow Analysis
This repository contains a modular Jupyter workflow for classifying trading sessions based on gap behavior, session structure, and closing position relative to prior range. It builds a three-stage behavioral funnel to empirically map market rhythm and flow tendencies.

ðŸ“¦ What This Pipeline Does
1. Session Filtering & Aggregation
Filters raw tick-level data to valid trading sessions (07:00â€“15:59).

Aggregates into 2-minute OHLCV buckets for structural clarity.

2. Session-Level Summary
Computes daily high/low/close and compares to prior session range.

Tags each session as:

Inside (0) or Outside (1) previous day's range.

Overlapping (0) or Non-overlapping (1) range structure.

3. Gap Classification
Extracts 07:00 and 09:30 open prices.

Classifies each session into one of four gap types:

0: No Gap

1: Morning Gap

2: Overnight & Morning Gap

3: Fake Gap

4: Catch-All (fallback)

4. Behavioral Flow Mapping
Combines gap type, session classification, and close behavior into 3-stage flows.

Computes joint probabilities for each flow.

Visualizes flow distributions with bar charts and pie grids.

5. Flow Scoring & Exploration
Calculates conditional probabilities and flow ratios.

Enables empirical validation of behavioral setups across regimes.

ðŸ“Š Visual Outputs
Gap type distributions

Session classification probabilities

Conditional bar charts: Close vs Prev Range | Gap Type

2Ã—2 pie grid: Session Ã— Close behavior for each Gap Type

ðŸ”§ Modular Extensions (Planned)
Regime memory tracking

Flow scoring engine

Dash-based interactive dashboard

Behavioral overlay tagging for rhythm segmentation

ðŸ§  Why This Matters
This framework is designed for traders and researchers seeking structural clarity and behavioral transparency. It supports rhythm engine development, regime tagging, and expectation-driven market analysis.
